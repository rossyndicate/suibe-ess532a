## The Assignment:

*Tip: View this in the visual editor in RStudio*

You want to re-create the word document shared with this assignment titled `Debugged_Document.docx`. Below is the workflow to do so, ***however*** you will notice if you attempt to render this R Markdown document as is, it does NOT reproduce the `Debugged_Document.docx` file, and it won't even render until you fix some of the mistakes/missing elements. Therefore, this workflow is not reproducible! Your task is to fix the below coding workflow so that it renders and **exactly** matches the output of `Debugged_Document.docx` (*including* whether or not certain code chunks and/or outputs are shown).

There are a total of **5 fixes** you need to make to the workflow below. To complete this assignment you must identify the 5 errors and specify what they are.

**List here the 5 errors you had to fix in this workflow:**

1.  Set `echo = FALSE` to remove the display of code

2.  Load in the {tidyverse}

3.  In the pressure vs. wind speed plot, you needed to add the color argument to `geom_point(aes(x = pressure, y = wind, color = lat), alpha = 0.75, cex = 3)`

4.  In the hurricane's maximum diameter vs. time data frame, `hurricanes` is spelled wrong.

5.  ... and, the `hurricanes` object needs to be created to make the final plot

#### The NOAA Atlantic Hurricane Dataset

This exploratory workflow uses the `atlantic_storms.csv` file in the data folder for this lesson. This dataset is based on the NOAA Atlantic hurricane database (<https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/#hurdat>). The data includes storm tracks of storms from 1975-2021, as well as some characteristics (like wind and air pressure) during their progression. Storms from 1979 onward are measured every six hours during the lifetime of the storm. Storms in earlier years have some missing data. Descriptions of each variable in the dataset can be found in `data/atlantic_storms_desc.txt`.

We read in the data and initially explore its structure:

```{r}
storms <- read_csv("data/atlantic_storms.csv")
summary(storms)
```

Let's first explore wind speed across all the different storm types with a histogram:

```{r warning=FALSE}
storms %>% 
  ggplot()+
  geom_histogram(aes(x = wind, fill = status)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(color = "Storm Type") + 
  ylab("Count") +
  xlab("Sustained Wind Speed (knots)") 
```

Now we want to visualize the relationship between pressure and wind speed *across latitudes*, where higher latitudes (blue) indicate locations further north:

```{r warning=FALSE}
storms %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = pressure, y = wind, color = lat), alpha = 0.75, cex = 3) +
  scale_color_gradientn(colors = c( "red", "green", "darkblue")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(fill = "Latitude") + 
  xlab("Pressure (millibars)") +
  ylab("Sustained Wind Speed (knots)") 
```

Finally, let's visualize each hurricane's maximum diameter through the years:

```{r}
hurricanes <- storms %>% 
  filter(status == 'hurricane') %>%
  group_by(name, year) %>%
  summarize(max_force_diameter = max(hurricane_force_diameter)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(max_force_diameter))
```

```{r warning=FALSE}
hurricanes %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = as.factor(year), y = max_force_diameter), color = "darkblue", fill = "skyblue") +
  theme_minimal() +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Maximum Diameter (nautical miles)")
```
